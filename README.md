# Orchide's Strategy in leading the development of Tekana_Wallet

## Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

At the very beginning of the project we start by colaborating with all the business stakeholders to define and the understanding the requirements of the payment system as well as the schope of the project . It's within these meetings that things like back of the envelope budget for the technical tools that are required for the completion of the project are conceived . I prefer not to dwell a lot in the Lehman terms of the project . a sprint or two would suffice .

## Stage 2 . Defining Requirements

Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

## Stage 3 Product Design

Starting with design mockups , our UIX and FrontEnd engineer would quickly get started with the visual product design as i busy myself with various architectures that will satisfy the requirements , here the compiled designs will be prosented to the stakeholders in an inception report that communicates the ins and outs of the product as well as the data flow , budget and time constraints . with a payment system in question here is where the compliance team will get us the necessary greenlights and documents to be able to proceed .

## Stage 4 Development

In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle.

Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming and tools for the chosen technology stack should be readily available , atleast as far as UAT .




## Stage 5: Testing the Product




Depending on the design approach , if the application was designed with TDD in mind this stage will relatively be quicker , however on most projects what to be tested isn't clear until it's developed so at this stage in addition to units that are tested by engineers during development, we test the application for integrations and end to end use cases . broken features are fixed in iterations/sprints until the ideal functionality is achieved.





## Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance



Here the product is by far and large ready for usage by the public , as a lead engineer on this project it's my duty to ensure that the infrastructure on which the applications will seat is deployed and secured , and also facilitate the installation of CI/CD pipelines for better integration .




Payment systems in my opinion are best developed following the Iterative lifecycle of a product due to the number of different components that need to be working in symphony for a distinguished user experience .
